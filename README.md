# MAVE-IAPP

Raw sequencing data and the processed data table required for running the pipeline are deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) as GSE281555. 

- Script 00A and 00B are required to obtain the data tables needed to complete the figures. 
- Script F1-F6 & S1-S15 can be run independently and contain all the code required to create all the figures in the manuscript. 
- Required data folder contains all the required data to run all the scripts found in the repository.
  
All the scripts have been run in R version 4.4.3. UCSF Chimera - version 1.14 - has been used to colour PDB structures.

The run-time is ~2h in total on a normal desktop computer.

# MAVE-IAPP

Raw sequencing data and the processed data table required for running the pipeline are deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) as GSE281555.
Script 01_processed data file.R outputs the processed data table from DiMSum output
Script 02 (required) outputs the complete data table for each mutation type subset for downstream analysis. All other scripts (03-16) can be run independently
The run-time is <1h in total on a normal desktop computer.
